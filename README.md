## My Brain
Welcome to the little slice of the internet that will house my brain...or the slice I don't need right now.

## Why Care
My journey into technology - and through life - has not been a straight line. However, I would not forego any experience because combined they make me uniquely gifted at one thing. What is that one thing? My superpower? I am uniquely able to solve multi-dimensional, difficult problems where the exact inputs, constraints, and even resources are unclear going in.

I have used this skill to go from a management consultant to real estate investor. From real estate investor to renovator. From home renovator to mortgage broker. From mortgage broker to a developer bad debt negotiator after 2008. From debt negotiator to broader small business consultant. From consultant to analytics firm. From analytics firm to private equity entrepreneur. From private equity entrepreneur back to analytics as a Data Scientist using python to analyze deals. Finally, today I primarily solve problems with software engineering that use fullstack technologies as the View in MVC (Model-View-Controller).

Whew. As I said, not a straight line.

A long time ago, this type of broad skillset would have been a positive. Hell, there's a name for it. However, today, you are called a generalist. In our increasingly limited attention span society, this may as well be an insult. A recruiter isn't going to look at your resume and see possibilities. They are going to look for resumes that fit into the pre-defined peg they want to fill.

So, if you, like me, are a circle peg, that everyone keeps trying to shove into a square peg, let's connect here. Together, we can build a fun place to hang.
